# Smart-Dustbin-using-arduino

The Smart Dustbin is a project that uses Arduino to create a smart dustbin that can automatically open and close its lid, and also indicate whether it is full or not. The Smart Dustbin uses two ultrasonic sensors, one to detect objects in close proximity and the other to detect the level of trash in the bin. When an object is detected by the first sensor, the lid of the bin will open automatically. When the level of trash in the bin reaches a certain threshold, the second sensor will detect this and a buzzer will sound to indicate that the bin is full. The level of trash in the bin will also be displayed on an LCD screen.

**Code Working**
The Smart Dustbin project aims to create an automated waste management system using Arduino and ultrasonic sensors. The dustbin is equipped with two ultrasonic sensors: one to detect the fill level of the dustbin and the other to open the door when an object approaches. The system also includes a buzzer to alert when the dustbin is full and an LCD display to show the fill level.

When the first ultrasonic sensor detects the fill level of the dustbin, it sends the data to the Arduino. If the dustbin is full, the Arduino triggers the buzzer to turn on, indicating that it needs to be emptied. The second ultrasonic sensor is positioned near the door of the dustbin. When an object comes near the sensor, the Arduino detects the proximity and opens the door to allow the user to dispose of waste.

The LCD display is used to show the fill level of the dustbin. It provides a visual representation of how much space is remaining in the dustbin. The display might use a graphical representation such as a bar or a percentage value to indicate the fill level.

**Conclusion:**
The smart dustbin is a simple and effective way to manage waste. It is easy to build and can be used in a variety of settings, such as homes, schools, and businesses. The smart dustbin can help to reduce the spread of germs and keep our environment clean.
